In the modern-day business landscape, success relies on adapting to emerging technologies
like quantum computing; we aimed to provide the solution by comparing the performance of QML and Classical ML to see
if QML can effectively address and enhance the financial decision-making process.
We worked on a real-world dataset of Singapore Central Bank real estate data with varying numbers of features for a fixed
data size. We benchmarked and compared various QML algorithms like VQR and QSVR with two different ansatz
(RealAmplitude and EfficientSU2) and Q-KNN by running it locally on various CPUs to reach mean absolute error, mean
squared error, and root mean squared error and the time required to fit the model, predict, and score.
Our project succeeded as we compared the results from QML and Classical ML well enough to convince modern-day
businesses to adapt to quantum or hybrid classical-quantum technology.
This project was part of the Ultrahack Quantum Hackathon â€“ 2023 under the team name GateCrashers. We won the
recognition award to visit IBM Quantum and AI company site in Finland.
